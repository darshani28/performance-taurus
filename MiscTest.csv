This was a birthday trip to mother and sister and I wanted everything to be as perfect as possible. Chantal the resident manager made it all happen with the most warm and personal touches including balloons champagne a cake and gifts waiting in our room upon our arrival. Chantal and I had been emailing each other in the weeks preceeding the trip and I felt as if I knew her as a friend when we finally arrived.  This was by far the best hotel I have stayed at in London out of my previous 4 stays. The hotel itself is quaint yet beautiful with a cozy at-home feeling. From the street the entrance is quite inconspicuous and private which is very nice. The overall style is what I would describe as contemporary old-world style meets traditional English. The executive lounge is a large gorgeous living room type of space with multiple seating areas that are also for the morning breakfast sittings. In the evenings a well stocked bar is set up for evening cocktails. The very unconventional reception area is also here in this room as a mere executive desk with a flat screen computer monitor and two guest chairs. There's also an open loft in this room with additional seating desks and computers for business use.  The bedrooms themselves are absolutely lovely consistent with the look and feel of the rest of the hotel and very well equiped with everything you could possibly need. A web-tv type of set-up with cordless keyboard makes e-mail and internet access so very convenient. There is a fax machine mini bar cordless telephone to use anywhere in the hotel spacious closets and bathroom large enough to accomodate 3 of us ladies staying in the same room (now that is important!). There was a separate shower and bathtub and a lot of counter space.  I could go on and on about this place. Chantal and her staff could not be any more cordial and accomodating. We had originally planned to stay 4 days and 4 nights but ended up staying and extra day since we were having so much fun.

There was a separate shower and bathtub and a lot of counter space.  I could go on and on about this place. Chantal and her staff could not be any more cordial and accomodating. We had originally planned to stay 4 days and 4 nights but ended up staying and extra day since we were having so much fun. Needless to say I would stay at the 41 again and again and highly recommend it!Lucas,7/31/15,Automation QA,31/12/1966 03:40:00 PM,4,"$4,094.81",5.17731E+15,Leonardville,7567,1,Aenean@adipiscingnonluctus.co.uk,, Had a great time here. The Dusty Baron show was outstanding. The chinese buffet was Excellent. Fremont St. much better than the strip. Looking forward to my next trip there.Hall,9/30/13,Group Manager,31/12/1966 03:50:00 PM,7,"$3,676.79",5.18512E+15,Bronx,96361,3,adipiscing.fringilla.porttitor@tinciduntnequevitae.edu,Tiger, A much needed Girls Weekend. First time in a W. Now we understand what all the rave is about! We had a ball. Super hotel! Definately different than any other place we've ever stayed. Not for all travelers though. Funky sexy chic loud music busy--fun fun fun!! So far from our lives as young moms with 3 young children at home. We traveled for a long weekend Nov. 7-11 2003. I highly recommend this hotel. GREAT STAFF-very personable and accomodating. Book it-you'll be glad you did!Carson,11/11/13,Developer,31/12/1977 02:30:00 PM,6,"$3,126.24",4.57744E+15,Brownsboro,6712,3,Donec@ornareegestas.net,Possum, Certainly does not have the WOW factor which it affords itself in it's own descriptions. I was completely underwhelmed.
